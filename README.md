# Emotion Detection from Text using Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a robust deep learning-based system to detect human emotions from textual input. Leveraging advanced models like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers, the system identifies emotions such as **joy, sadness, anger, fear**, and **surprise** with high accuracy.

## üîç Overview

The system is designed to process user-entered text and classify the underlying emotion using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques. Attention mechanisms are used to enhance the model‚Äôs focus on emotionally relevant parts of the input text.

## üß† Core Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- RNN, LSTM, Transformer models
- NLP techniques (Tokenization, Embedding, Attention)
- Dataset: Emotion-labeled corpora (e.g., Emotion Dataset from Kaggle)

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time emotion classification from text input
- Support for five core emotions: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise
- Attention mechanism for improved accuracy
- Scalable architecture for future multimodal and multilingual extensions

## üí° Applications

- Mental health analysis
- Customer service sentiment detection
- Social media emotion tagging
- Empathetic AI interaction

## üîÆ Future Work

- Cross-lingual emotion detection
- Multimodal emotion recognition (text + audio + video)
- Expansion to include nuanced emotional categories
